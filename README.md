# JavaScript OTP Code Entry Form

A small set of javascript functions to power a dynamic OTP code entry form with auto-submission. Obviously, in production scenarios the code generation and validation is done in back-end. Currently using Bootstrap.css v5 for styling but it is not necessary and does not provide any functinality in this set-up.
